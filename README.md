Welcome to the repository for my master's thesis, "Numerical Simulation for the Langevin and Fokker-Planck Equations for Sigle-Molecule Trapping". This work focuses on modeling and simulating the behavior of particles when trapped using dielectrophoresis, with two main approaches: the Langevin Equation and the Fokker-Planck Equation. The codes built for these simulations were obtained with the help of the following: https://github.com/johnaparker/fplanck and https://github.com/zaman13/Brownian-dynamics-in-a-time-varying-force-field.
